# White-Box-attacks-on-FL
This repo contains the implementation of three white-box attacks on the Federated Learning framework. The main aim was to check if the ML model is successful in fooling the model. This was made possible by adding certain amount/opacity of the perturbations on the original images. CIFAR10 was used for carrying out the experiment.
